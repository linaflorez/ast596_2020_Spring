## ASTR 596 Final Exam

1. You get to pick the project, but I get to pick the team.
2. Your project must use *two* of the broad ideas we cover in the second half of class
    - time-series analysis
    - hierarchical Bayesian modeling
    - dealing with selection effects in data when building models
    - machine learning
3. Your project must deal with an astrophysical dataset (real or simulated) from the literature - i.e. no coming up with some toy model data on your own
4. Part of your final is also going to be identifying a context outside of astrophysics that your analysis is useful, or similar to existing work
5. Proposals for projects from teams are due by April 28th, 2020 - if you can't pick by then I will
6. Create a new git repo for your work, and send me a link - I'll be viewing progress and meeting with you all the week before finals 
7. In your repo, maintain a statement of work, with what each team member is working on
8. Divide up the tasks in your project however you see fit, but each of you need to be writing code and pushing to git - no making one person do all the work
9. On week 0, I claimed that the best test to see if you know something is being able to explain it to someone else - so you get to do a presentation/writeup
10. Use jupyter + rise as we've been doing throughout class
11. But this means that final presentations/writeups are more conversational than formal final presentations - think more like journal club
12. And of course before you can explain what you did to everyone else, you'd better be able to explain what you did to each other...
13. So rather than one person doing a presentation, all of you will switch off and present sections of the final presentations, but everyone else gets to ask anyone in your team questions about each section
14. Your team gets a grade - this might be frustrating if you are used to individual accomplishment, but science doesn't actually work that way anymore
